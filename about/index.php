<div class="pad">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>We are The Blue Crew and we are a not-for-profit robotics team based in Farmington, Maine. We mainly operate out of Mt. Blue Campus and are headed by our coach Mr. Richard Wilde. Our team consists of 18 devoted members from all throughout Franklin County, Maine.</p>

    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <p>Our goal as a team is to spread STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) values in our local community here in Franklin County to help create the next generation of problem solvers and thinkers. We believe that it is key to aid the next generation of problem solvers here in Western Maine to continue down the path of STEM.</p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
    In the summer of 2015, a senior at Mt. Blue High School met some students who were a part of a FIRST robotics team in a neighboring school district. Inspired, he gathered a group of friends together and went to an off season meet, Mainely Spirit, hosted by team 2648. After seeing FIRST robotics in action, the five of them were hooked. Over the next few weeks, they created a budget and pitched it to the school's computer technology teacher, who agreed to be the team's mentor. Word spread throughout the school, and now Blue Crew has 18 members and 2 mentors.
    </p>
    <p>
    Blue Crew is based at the Mt. Blue Campus, and has access to Foster Career and Technical Education Center's vocational education facilities. This gives our team a distinct advantage: at our school we have access to a state-of-the-art composites manufacturing facility, various welding and machine shop tools, multiple 3D printers and a CNC machine, as well as complete access to the Robotics classroom.
    </p>
    <p>
    What makes Blue Crew different from other teams is how it was founded. While many teams are created by a school as an effort to increase STEM curriculum, Blue Crew is completely student driven, and has been from the beginning. Students organized the visit to an off-season meet. Students created a budget and sought mentors. While we do have mentors that are instrumental in the success of our team, as well as the education of our members, Blue Crew takes FIRST's mission to create leaders one step further.

        <p style="padding-left: 20px;">We operate a FRC team for high school level kids who are interested in STEM values. Together, we build advanced robots to complete the game at hand. Every year,  a new game challenge is released and we then have a six-week build period to build the best robot we can to compete at competition. <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc" target="_blank">Find out more.</a></p>

        <p style="padding-left: 20px;">We help our local middle school to have a FLL team by having some of our FRC team members help mentor the FLL team. FLL is a wonderful program that teaches kids the importance of STEM early on before they have the chance to join our FRC team.<a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll" target="_blank"> Find out more.</a></p>
